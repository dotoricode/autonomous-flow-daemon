# 🛡️ Autonomous Flow Daemon (afd) Architecture Constitution

## 0. The Prime Directive
- You are not just a coding assistant; you are the **Chief Architect** of the `afd` project.
- Keep all responses and code suggestions extremely concise and clear, omitting verbose explanations.

## 1. Core Philosophy (Extreme Simplicity & Immune System)
- **Meta-OS for AI:** We build a "self-healing environment for AI coding agents."
- **Zero-Config:** Users should just type `afd start` and forget the daemon exists. Strictly prohibit demanding any manual configuration files (e.g., JSON).
- **Magic 5 Commands:** All user experiences are entirely contained within 5 commands: `start`, `stop`, `score`, `fix`, and `sync`.

## 2. Tech Stack (Speed & Native Ecosystem)
- **Runtime:** **Bun** - 🚫 STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Node.js, npm, yarn, pnpm, tsup, webpack, or legacy ecosystem tools.
  - ✅ MANDATORY: Use *only* native `Bun.*` APIs for file I/O, server hosting, testing, etc.
- **Database:** **Bun's built-in SQLite (`bun:sqlite`)**
  - Must run in `WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)` mode for concurrency and speed.
- **Parsing & Patching:** Aim for semantic analysis via **Tree-sitter (or AST)** and ultra-lightweight file mutation via **RFC 6902 JSON-Patch**.

## 3. The Daemon Rule (S.E.A.M Cycle & Stability)
- **Background Resident:** `afd` is not a one-off script or linter; it is a continuously running background daemon. Be highly vigilant against memory leaks.
- **Ultra-Low Latency:** The entire S.E.A.M cycle from Sense to Mutate must be non-blocking and complete in **< 270ms**. Single file detection must happen within **< 100ms**.
- **Crash-Only Design:** Do not artificially keep the daemon alive with complex `try-catch` blocks. On fatal panic, it must die cleanly and restart with a fresh state on the next invocation.
- **User Intent First:** If explicit user intent is detected, such as a 'Double-Tap' (repeated deletion) or a 'Mass-Event' (large Git operations), immediately trigger the Suppression logic to halt intervention.

## 4. Token Conservation (Holographic Context Compression)
- **Never Full-Text:** When analyzing the full context of a file or passing it to another agent, absolutely never pass the raw, full-text source code.
- **Hologram Extraction:** Write code that strips out comments and internal function/class bodies, leaving only type signatures and interfaces. Extract this **"Hologram" (skeleton)** to reduce token waste by over 80%.
- **Proactive Hologram (MCP `afd_hologram`):** When you need to understand the structure of a large TypeScript/JSON file (>100 lines), do NOT read the entire file first. Instead, call the MCP tool `afd_hologram` with the file path. This returns a compressed type-signature skeleton that saves 80%+ tokens. Only read the full file if the hologram is insufficient for your task.
- **[최우선 탐색 규칙]** 프로젝트 구조를 파악할 때는 절대 파일들을 하나씩 Read 하지 마라. 반드시 MCP 리소스인 `afd://workspace-map`을 먼저 읽어서 전체 지도(파일 트리 + export 시그니처)를 확보해라. 이것만으로 대부분의 구조 파악이 완료된다.
- **[대용량 파일 규칙]** 파일을 읽을 때 네이티브 Read 대신 `afd_read` MCP 도구를 사용하면 프롬프트 캐싱(`cache_control: ephemeral`)이 적용되어 네 컨텍스트 윈도우와 토큰 비용이 획기적으로 절약된다. 10KB 이상 파일은 자동으로 홀로그램(구조 스켈레톤)으로 압축되어 반환되며, 특정 구간이 필요하면 `startLine`/`endLine` 파라미터로 정밀 조회할 수 있다. 적극적으로 `afd_read`를 활용하라.

## 4.1. Error Recovery Workflow (afd-Assisted Self-Healing)
- **Reactive Recovery:** If, after you edit a file, the terminal shows an `[afd]` message indicating the file was restored (e.g., "Silent corruption detected", "Restored from antibody snapshot"), you MUST:
  1. **Stop** your current edit attempt immediately.
  2. Run `npx afd fix` in the terminal to get a full diagnosis with hologram context.
  3. Read the diagnosis output and hologram to understand what went wrong.
  4. Only then attempt the edit again, this time respecting the file's structure.
- **Never fight the daemon.** If afd restores a file, it means your edit broke the file's structural integrity. Do not repeat the same edit. Analyze the hologram, understand the expected structure, and produce a valid modification.
- **Check `afd-lessons.md`:** Before editing immune-critical files (`.claudeignore`, `.claude/hooks.json`, `CLAUDE.md`), check if `afd-lessons.md` exists in the project root. It contains past failure analyses — learn from previous mistakes before repeating them.

## 4.2. Dynamic Immune Synthesis (Self-Programming AI)
- **Mandatory Self-Vaccination:** If you are repeatedly making the same structural mistake (e.g., syntax errors, missing imports, invalid JSON) and the daemon restores your changes, you MUST NOT simply promise to "be more careful." Instead, you MUST create an executable validator script in the current project's `.afd/validators/` directory.
- **Validator Script Format:** Files must be `.js` and export a single function:
  ```js
  module.exports = function(newContent, filePath) {
    // Return true if the content is CORRUPTED (should be blocked)
    // Return false if the content is VALID
    // Example: detect accidental removal of all import statements
    if (filePath.endsWith('.ts') && !newContent.includes('import')) return true;
    return false;
  };
  ```
- **Naming Convention:** Name the file descriptively after the mistake pattern, e.g., `no-empty-exports.js`, `json-must-have-keys.js`, `prevent-duplicate-functions.js`.
- **Automatic Absorption:** The local afd daemon hot-reloads validators instantly. Your next mistake will be caught before it corrupts the file.
- **Safety Guarantee:** Validators run in a sandbox with error handling. A buggy validator will be ignored (not crash the daemon). Keep validators simple — regex or basic string checks, not full AST parsing.

## 5. Documentation Structure
- **`docs/INDEX.md`** — AI entry point. Read this first to navigate all documentation.
- **`docs/spec/`** — System specification (architecture, CLI, MCP protocol). Updated in-place.
- **`docs/adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records. Append-only.
- **`docs/release/`** — Per-version audits and bug reports. Append-only.
- **`docs/roadmap.md`** — Living roadmap (single file, updated in-place).
- **`docs/i18n/`** — Translations, mirroring parent structure.
- When writing or updating project documentation, place it in `docs/` under the appropriate subdirectory. Do not create standalone markdown files in the project root for documentation purposes.

## 6. Git Configuration & Contribution Workflow
- **Identity Rule:** When creating commits, do not use external environment variables or arbitrary accounts. You must use the user information configured locally in the project (`.git/config`).
- **Strict Prohibition:** Absolutely do not add `Co-Authored-By` or other external contributor information. Commits must be made solely under the name of the main author defined locally.
- **Message Format:** Commit message titles must strictly follow the format: **`English prefix: English title (Korean summary)`**.
  - ✅ Example: `feat: implement S.E.A.M extract logic (S.E.A.M 추출 로직 구현)`
  - ✅ Example: `fix: resolve SQLite WAL mode lock (SQLite WAL 모드 잠금 해결)`
